Transit Search Optimization Algorithm

This repository contains Python code implementing an optimization algorithm inspired by the successful methods used to detect exoplanets, namely 'Transit Search'. 

Structure:
    Main File: The primary script that executes the optimization algorithm. It calls the Cost_Function and TransitSearchmodules.
    Cost_Function: Defines the cost function to be minimized during the optimization process. This file includes detailed documentation of the cost function, its parameters, and any relevant assumptions.
    TransitSearch: The core of the optimization algorithm, implementing the search strategy inspired by exoplanet transit methods. This module is called by the Main File.
